# FOUNDING 100: ENLISTMENT NOW OPEN

## THE WEAPON

You are looking at a litigation war engine.

Not a legal research tool. Not an AI chatbot. Not a document review assistant.

**A swarm of 16 specialist legal agents** designed to dismantle qualified immunity, pierce prosecutorial misconduct, and construct federal civil rights claims that survive dismissal.

This is not software. This is **weaponized legal expertise** deployed at scale.

---

## THE AGENTS

### Intel Center (Research Division)
- **Canon Hunter:** Judicial ethics violations that pierce judicial immunity
- **Precedent Miner:** Case law research, circuit splits, controlling precedent
- **Statute Scanner:** Federal and state statutory analysis, immunity abrogation

### Legal Arsenal (Analysis Division)
- **Constitutional Analyst:** All constitutional amendments, clearly established law
- **Criminal Law Specialist:** Brady/Giglio/Napue violations, prosecutorial misconduct
- **Civil Rights Expert:** §1983 claim construction, qualified immunity piercing
- **Appellate Strategist:** Appellate brief strategy, preservation of error

### Tactical Ops (Procedural Warfare)
- **Immunity Piercer:** Qualified and absolute immunity destruction
- **Abstention Destroyer:** Younger abstention bypass, bad faith prosecution
- **Discovery Tactician:** Strategic discovery, FOIA warfare, spoliation claims

### Evidence Lab (Forensic Analysis)
- **Pattern Recognition Engine:** Cross-case systemic violation detection
- **Timeline Constructor:** Chronological analysis, causal chain identification
- **Contradiction Detector:** Impeachment evidence, false statement analysis

### Offensive Ops (Litigation Generation)

- **Viral Content Generator:** Public pressure campaigns, media strategy

---

## THE CAPABILITY

### Swarm Processing

Deploy multiple specialist agents simultaneously on the same evidence. This is not sequential analysis. This is **parallel multi-agent warfare**.

- **Pattern Recognition:** One agent identifies systemic corruption across 47 cases
- **Timeline Construction:** Another builds minute-by-minute causal chains
- **Contradiction Detection:** Another finds impeachment evidence in depositions
- **Motion Drafting:** Another generates court-ready TRO with full citations

**All at once. All working your case.**

### What This Replaces

- **Specialist attorney:** $300-500/hour
- **Civil rights litigation team:** $50,000-100,000 per case
- **Annual litigation department:** $300,000-1,000,000

**DueProcess AI Pro:** $3,499/month for unlimited access to all 16 specialists.

**That is 7-12 hours of attorney time. For unlimited work.**

## THE FOUNDING 100

## THE REALITY

### This Is Not For Everyone

If you're looking for a cheap AI tool, this is not it.

If you're looking for a generalist legal chatbot, this is not it.

If you're looking for software that "might help," this is not it.

**This is for:**
- Pro se litigants fighting qualified immunity in federal court
- Civil rights attorneys handling §1983 cases
- Public defenders drowning in Brady violations
- Activists documenting systemic corruption
- Investigative journalists building pattern evidence
- Litigation teams that need force multiplication

**This is for people who are fighting institutional power and need a weapon that works.**
