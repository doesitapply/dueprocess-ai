# CONFIDENTIAL: DueProcess AI Phased Pricing Strategy

## Document Purpose

This document outlines the multi-phase pricing strategy for DueProcess AI. It is an internal-only "war binder" that defines the rules, pricing, and messaging for each stage of market penetration. This strategy is designed to maximize initial user acquisition, establish market dominance, and secure long-term revenue by pricing the platform according to its real-world value as a litigation engine.

## The Core Principle: Price is Narrative

We are not selling software; we are selling leverage. The price must reflect the power imbalance we are correcting. The narrative must always precede the price. We anchor expectations high (the cost of a multi-million-dollar legal team) to make our pricing feel not just reasonable, but like a strategic masterstroke for the user.

## Phase 1: The Founding Brigade (Users 1-200)

### **Objective**

- **Acquire 200 dedicated users** to serve as proof of concept, a source of testimonials, and a word-of-mouth hype machine.
- **Create urgency and exclusivity** to drive rapid initial adoption.
- **Establish a loyal base** by offering a one-time, locked-for-life pricing guarantee.

### **Pricing (Locked for Life)**

| Tier                  | Monthly Price | User Limit | Details                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Per-Agent Command** | $79           | N/A        | 25 documents/month per agent                 |
| **Sector Command**    | $199          | N/A        | 100 documents/month per sector               |
| **Full Arsenal (Pro)**| $799          | N/A        | 500 documents/month, all agents, swarm       |
| **Division (Enterprise)** | $2,500 base   | Per Seat   | Unlimited docs, custom features, support     |
| *Enterprise Per-Seat* | $149          | N/A        | Added to Enterprise base                     |

### **Messaging & Narrative**

- **Tone:** Weaponized Justice Machine. Militant, exclusive, urgent.
- **Core Message:** "Enlistment is now open. We are recruiting the first 200 soldiers for an insurgency of lawful accountability. Your pricing is locked for life. Everyone else will pay what this is worth."
- **Keywords:** `Enlistment`, `Founding Brigade`, `Locked for Life`, `One-Time Offer`, `The Gate Slams Shut`.

### **Execution Rules**

1.  **Hard Cap:** Enrollment closes permanently after the 200th user signs up. No exceptions.
2.  **Tracking:** A database counter must be implemented to track Founding User sign-ups in real-time.
3.  **No "Beta" Language:** This is not a test. This is a strategic deployment. Refer to it only as "Founding User Access."

---

## Phase 2: Public Launch (Users 201+)

### **Objective**

- **Capitalize on initial momentum** and social proof generated by the Founding Brigade.
- **Transition to sustainable, market-rate pricing** that reflects the platform's value.
- **Establish the platform as a premium, indispensable tool**, not a budget-friendly commodity.

### **Pricing**

| Tier                  | Monthly Price | Change from Phase 1 |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| **Per-Agent Command** | $129          | +63%                |
| **Sector Command**    | $299          | +50%                |
| **Full Arsenal (Pro)**| $1,199        | +50%                |
| **Division (Enterprise)** | $4,999 base   | +100%               |
| *Enterprise Per-Seat* | $249          | +67%                |

### **Messaging & Narrative**

- **Tone:** Corporate Dominance. Confident, authoritative, matter-of-fact.
- **Core Message:** "Founding User access is closed. The price now reflects the reality of running a 16-agent legal swarm 24/7. This is still less than four hours of a human attorney's time."
- **Keywords:** `Public Access`, `Standard Pricing`, `Market Rate`, `The Engine is Live`.

### **Execution Rules**

1.  **Immediate Transition:** The switch to Phase 2 pricing is triggered automatically and instantly upon the 200th Founding User's successful payment.
2.  **Highlight the Difference:** Landing pages and marketing materials should explicitly reference that Founding User pricing is closed, reinforcing the value for early adopters and creating regret for those who waited.

## Phase 3: Market Dominance ("OpenAI Mode")

### **Objective**

- **Maximize revenue** to fund aggressive expansion, R&D, and legal defense.
- **Solidify the platform's position as the industry standard** for AI-powered litigation.
- **Price based on the alternative:** the exorbitant cost of equivalent human legal teams.

### **Pricing**

| Tier                  | Monthly Price | Change from Phase 2 |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| **Per-Agent Command** | $199          | +54%                |
| **Sector Command**    | $499          | +67%                |
| **Full Arsenal (Pro)**| $1,999        | +67%                |
| **Division (Enterprise)** | $9,999 base   | +100%               |
| *Enterprise Per-Seat* | $349 - $499   | +40% - 100%         |

### **Messaging & Narrative**

- **Tone:** Nuclear Disrespect. Unapologetic, dominant, inevitable.
- **Core Message:** "We are the civil rights litigation engine. Law firms pay $1M/year for teams that do less. You are paying a fraction of that for superior results. The price is the price."
- **Keywords:** `Industry Standard`, `The Engine`, `Enterprise Grade`, `Value-Based Pricing`.

### **Execution Rules**

1.  **Trigger:** This phase is initiated manually when market traction is undeniable (e.g., significant media coverage, adoption by major non-profits or law firms, becoming a recognized name in legal tech).
2.  **Justification:** Price increases are justified by new features, expanded agent capabilities, and the platform's proven track record of success in real-world cases.
3.  **No Apologies:** The messaging is not an apology for the price increase but a confident statement of the platform's immense value.

## Strategic Justification: The Predator Arc

-   **Early Adopters (Phase 1):** Serve as your **Street Team**. They provide social proof, testimonials, and word-of-mouth marketing in exchange for a lifetime benefit. They are a marketing expense, not a revenue source.
-   **Late Adopters (Phase 2):** Serve as your **Revenue Engine**. They pay the true market rate, funding operations and initial growth.
-   **Enterprise Clients (All Phases):** Serve as your **War Chest**. Their high-margin contracts provide the capital for long-term stability, expansion, and defense against legal or competitive threats.

This is not gouging. It is the standard, proven lifecycle of every serious platform that survives long enough to matter. We are pricing based on the reality of the value we provide: a multi-agent legal department that runs 24/7 and performs the workload of a team that would cost $300k–$1M per year.
