# DueProcess AI - Litigation Warfare Platform

**16 specialist legal agents. Swarm processing. Pattern recognition. Court-ready output.**

This is not a legal research tool. This is a **multi-agent litigation warfare platform** designed to dismantle qualified immunity, pierce prosecutorial misconduct, and construct federal civil rights claims that survive dismissal.
