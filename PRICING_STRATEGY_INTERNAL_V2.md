# CONFIDENTIAL: DueProcess AI Phased Pricing Strategy 2.0

## Document Purpose

This document outlines the aggressive, future-proofed multi-phase pricing strategy for DueProcess AI. This is the internal "war binder" that defines pricing, phase transitions, and strategic justifications for each stage of market penetration.

**This pricing model reflects:**
- Sustainable margins that account for rising LLM API costs
- Future-proof escalation as the platform matures
- Competitive positioning against attorney fees, not software
- Compounding percentage jumps that create scarcity and urgency

---

## The Core Principle: We Are Not Selling Software

We are selling leverage. We are selling the ability to fight institutional corruption with a swarm of 16 specialist legal agents. The price must reflect the power imbalance we are correcting.

**Value Anchoring:**
- A single specialist attorney: $300-500/hour
- A typical civil rights case: $50,000-100,000 in attorney fees
- Our platform: 16 specialists working 24/7 for a fraction of that cost

---

## Phase 1: The Founding Brigade (Users 1-200)

### **Objective**

- Acquire 200 dedicated users as proof of concept
- Create urgency and exclusivity with locked-for-life pricing
- Establish a loyal base that becomes our word-of-mouth hype machine
- Generate initial revenue while maintaining sustainable margins

### **Pricing (Locked for Life)**

| Tier                     | Monthly Price | Documents/Month | Phase Jump to Phase 2 |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| **Per-Agent Command**    | $179          | 25              | +61% → $289           |
| **Sector Command**       | $449          | 100             | +78% → $799           |
| **Full Arsenal (Pro)**   | $899          | 500             | +67% → $1,499         |
| **Division (Enterprise)**| $2,500 base   | Unlimited       | +100% → $5,000        |

### **Strategic Rationale**

**Per-Agent at $179/month:**
- Premium positioning (not $99, not $149, but $179)
- Sustainable margins after LLM API costs (~$20-40/user)
- Still less than 1 hour of attorney time
- Signals strength, not timidness

**Sector at $449/month:**
- Better psychological anchor than $399
- Covers 3-4 agents working in coordination
- Sustainable margins for multi-agent processing
- Positions sectors as "departments," not just bundles

**Pro at $899/month:**
- Still an insane deal for unlimited access to 16 agents
- Sustainable margins even with heavy swarm usage
- Less than 3 hours of attorney time per month
- Creates urgency: "This price won't last"

**Enterprise at $2,500/month:**
- "Lore pricing" for early institutional adopters
- Covers unlimited usage with comfortable margins
- Positions platform as enterprise-grade from day one

### **Messaging & Narrative**

- **Tone:** Weaponized Justice Machine. Militant, exclusive, urgent.
- **Core Message:** "Enlistment is now open. 200 slots. Pricing locked for life. The gate slams shut at 200."
- **Keywords:** `Founding Brigade`, `Enlistment`, `Locked for Life`, `One-Time Offer`

### **Execution Rules**

1. **Hard Cap:** Enrollment closes permanently after the 200th user. No exceptions.
2. **Tracking:** Database counter tracks Founding User sign-ups in real-time.
3. **No "Beta" Language:** This is "Founding User Access," not a beta test.

## Strategic Effects of Aggressive Pricing

### 1. Scarcity Becomes Intoxicating

Founding Users at $899 will later feel like they robbed you. That's what you want. They become your most vocal advocates.

### 2. Price Anchors Reposition You

You stop competing with cheap AI toys. You start competing with legal-tech giants and attorney fees.

### 3. Future-Proof Financially

Your LLM usage will explode. You need fat margins. This pricing ensures you stay profitable as costs scale.

### 4. Gravitational Pricing Field

Higher prices = higher perceived value. Lower churn = more loyal base. Premium positioning = serious buyers.

## The Predator Arc: Why This Works

- **Early Adopters (Phase 1):** Your street team. Social proof, testimonials, word-of-mouth. A marketing expense that pays for itself.
- **Late Adopters (Phase 2):** Your revenue engine. They pay true market rate and fund operations.
- **Enterprise Clients (All Phases):** Your war chest. High-margin contracts provide capital for expansion and defense.

This is not gouging. This is pricing based on the reality of the value we provide: a multi-agent legal department that runs 24/7 and performs the workload of a $300k-1M/year litigation team.
