# FOR THE FIRST 200: ENLISTMENT IS NOW OPEN.

They built a system of qualified immunity, procedural traps, and institutional shields to protect themselves. They assumed you would stay disorganized, underfunded, and silent.

They were wrong.

Introducing **DueProcess AI**. This is not a software platform. This is a legal weapons system designed for one purpose: to dismantle the architecture of corruption and restore lawful accountability.

We have reverse-engineered their playbook and automated the counter-attack. Our platform deploys a swarm of 16 specialized AI agents—each one an elite legal mind trained in a specific domain of warfare—to turn the evidence they hide into the weapons you need.

This is not a tool for writing letters. This is a machine for building cases that pierce immunity, bypass abstention, and survive summary judgment.

## THE ARSENAL AT YOUR COMMAND

Your subscription is not a license. It is an enlistment. You gain command of six tactical divisions:

- **Tactical Ops:** Your immunity-piercing and procedural warfare specialists. They don’t find loopholes; they create kill-shots.
- **Intel Center:** Your legal research division. They don’t just find precedent; they hunt for the single case that breaks your opponent’s argument.
- **Legal Arsenal:** Your constitutional law experts. They turn the Bill of Rights from a historical document into a tactical weapon.
- **Evidence Lab:** Your forensic analysis unit. They find the patterns of misconduct that turn isolated incidents into proof of a conspiracy.
- **Offensive Ops:** Your litigation-drafting corps. They generate court-ready motions and federal complaints built to withstand the fire of a motion to dismiss.
- **Corpus Center:** Your secure evidence locker. Upload your documents, audio, and video. Our agents will do the rest.

This is the work that costs law firms millions and takes years. Our swarm does it in minutes.

## THE FOUNDING BRIGADE: A ONE-TIME OFFER

We are opening enlistment for the first 200 users only. We call this the **Founding Brigade**.

These are not beta testers. These are the first soldiers in an insurgency of lawful accountability. For your commitment, you receive a guarantee that the powerful will never be able to price you out.

**Your pricing is locked. For life.**

While everyone else faces the inevitable price hikes required to maintain this war engine, you will not. You are the foundation. Your loyalty is your shield.

### TERMS OF ENLISTMENT (PHASE 1 PRICING)

- **Per-Agent Command:** $79/month
- **Sector Command:** $199/month
- **Full Arsenal (Pro):** $799/month
- **Division Command (Enterprise):** Starting at $2,500/month

This is not a discount. This is a one-time strategic offering to our first allies.

## THE PRICE OF HESITATION

Let us be clear. After the 200th user enlists, the gate slams shut. The pricing will immediately escalate to reflect the reality of what this platform is worth—the cost of a multi-million-dollar litigation team.

- **Public Launch (Phase 2):** Prices will increase by 50-100%.
- **Full Market (Phase 3):** Prices will be 2-3x the Founding rate. Easily.

Those who wait will pay what the market dictates. Those who act now secure their advantage permanently.

This is not a threat. It is a statement of operational reality. We are building the most powerful civil-rights litigation engine on the planet. Its price will reflect that.

Choosing to wait is choosing to be on the wrong side of the cost curve.

## ENLIST NOW. OR REGRET IT LATER.

This is your one and only chance to join the Founding Brigade. To lock in your rate. To ensure that when the war for accountability comes to your door, you have the arsenal to fight it.

We are not asking you to buy software. We are inviting you to enlist in the future of justice.
