## DueProcess AI Value Proposition

### What Makes This Different

**Not a single AI assistant. A swarm of 16 specialist agents.**

| Feature | Single AI Tool | DueProcess AI |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Agents | 1 generalist | 16 specialists |
| Specialization | General legal | Domain experts (immunity, Brady, §1983, etc.) |
| Processing | Sequential | Parallel swarm processing |
| Sectors | N/A | 5 coordinated divisions |
| Pattern Recognition | Limited | Cross-case systemic analysis |
| Value Multiplier | 1x | 16x+ |

### The Math

- **Paxton AI:** $159/month for 1 AI assistant
- **DueProcess AI equivalent:** 16 specialist agents = $159 × 16 = **$2,544/month baseline**
- **Plus swarm processing:** Unique capability not available elsewhere
- **Plus sector coordination:** Multi-agent orchestration
- **Plus pattern recognition:** Cross-case analysis

**Conservative valuation: $3,000-5,000/month for Pro tier**
